The goal is to identify risky loan applicants so that such loans can be reduced, thereby cutting down
the amount of credit loss. 
The aim of this case study is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on thegiven dataset to identify 
these applicants.By identifying risky loan applicants, the company can minimize credit loss.

The objective is to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the
variables that are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for better
